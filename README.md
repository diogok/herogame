# Your Hero Game!

A quick game HTML5 for the [JS 13k Games](http://js13kgames.com) 2013 competition.

"Your Hero Game" is a very simple and generic dungeon explorer game. You play a rookie trying to become a hero, and to prove yourself worth you must complete a simpel quest: Return a stolen amulet from the evil Gathor!
